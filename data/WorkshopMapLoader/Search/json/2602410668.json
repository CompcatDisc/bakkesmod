{"Size":"80848009","Description":"Rocket League Super Rush is based on the same principles of Mario Golf Super Rush. It's a skills challenge in which you have to score as fast as possible by any means possible. It doesn't matter how you get it in, all that matters is the time at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nNETCODE IS REQUIRED! Plugin ID is '166'.\r\n\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nWhen you spawn for the first time, you will be assigned a color and a timer will start next to your name. You are also assigned a ball depending on your color. You are only given one ball, so if you want it to reset you have to put it into the floor. Everyone has their own timer. It's a free for all, so everyones goal is to score as quick as possible. After someone scores, everyone will have 15 seconds to score. Scoring will stop your timer from counting. If you don't score before the 15 seconds, your timer will continue to run. You can play for as long as you want, but whoever has the best time at the end wins!\r\n\r\n\r\nMutators:\r\nTime: Unlimited\r\nBoost: Unlimited\r\nDemo: Disabled (You can enable, but disabled is recommended)\r\nRespawn Time: 1 second\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLHF!"}
