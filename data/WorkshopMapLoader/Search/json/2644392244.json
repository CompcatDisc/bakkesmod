{"Size":"69779064","Description":"A new take on the most beautiful rings map made by Lethamyr.\n\nEvery single ring has been moved for a fresh and harder experience (since the original was fairly easy).\n\nIn addition I have added some buttons in the map. You can drive into them to skip to the level you want to play. This way, you can go straight to the harder levels or even practice a specific one over and over again.\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nSPEEDRUN CONTEST RULES:\n\nTo participate in the contest, you have to record your run of the map. When that is done, you can upload it on youtube (as unlisted if you don't want to make it public). Finally, head over to https://www.speedrun.com/rl#Neon_Heights_Rings and click on Submit run. Fill in the information (you can also add your discord to the description. If you win a prize and I can't reach out to you the prize will be rerolled), provide the link to your run and done!\n\nThe ruleset for the contest is 100%. This means you have to go in all of the rings and do every levels in order.\n\nThe contest ends on the 31st of January 2022 at midnight (EST). If your run has been submited after that time, it will not be eligible.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nPRIZEPOOL:\n\n1st: 80$\n2nd: 20$\nParticipation: 20$\n\n*The participation prize will be chosen at random from the leadearboard.
