Tips: Use the center ramp to get in the air quickly from the ground while conserving a flip; Land on the trampoline with all 4 tires to get the best bounce and conserve a flip; Hit down on the ball into the trampoline to bounce it higher; Recover from falling quickly by boosting fast towards the trampoline."}
