{"Size":"71692410","Description":"Original Map by TJ, modified to exclude defensive spawns by FenixD, then modified by me for single player mode. Multiple car/ball spawns have been disabled, ball spawns are now perfectly aligned with car spawns, and the shot numbers float above the goals now for better visibility and spatial awareness during air dribbles.\r\n\r\nHere's my freestyle/trickshot play through: https://youtu.be/JQAGiU7NmSY\r\n\r\nOriginal map: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2215294712\r\nNo defensive spawns map: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2383877804\r\n\r\nLinks to support TJ:\r\nSupport TJ on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/tjbrother\r\nhttps://twitch.tv/tjbrother\r\nhttps://twitter.com/tjbrotherlive\r\n\r\nLinks to support FenixD:\r\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fenixd_uk"}
