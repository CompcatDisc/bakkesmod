{"Size":"163029942","Description":"Defeat the pigs to free the eggs.\r\n9 Levels with the 9th starring the pig king.\r\n\r\n[h1]Single Player [/h1]\r\nincrease your accuracy and powershot capabilities while destroying pigs and stuff. Don't use ball reset. Unfortunately it will break this map. Sorry for that.\r\n\r\n[h1]Multiplayer [/h1]\r\nWhoever defeats the opposite team's pigs first, scores. You should increase the match length to 20 minutes or unlimited, if you want to play every level. If you want to play Rumble on this map, I recommend using the \"Spring Loaded\" mutator. Due to the fact, that all the pigs and blocks technically are custom shaped Game Balls, using default Rumble items may result in chaos (especially the magnet is OP).\r\n\r\n[url=https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/166]Cinderblocks Netcode Plugin[/url] recommended (without it only the host will see all the visual effects like TNT-explosions and animations).\r\n\r\n[h2]Important note:[/h2] \r\nIf you are using the \"swap maps\" method to play this map, please be advised, that only replacing \"Labs_Underpass_P.upk\" will work. Replacing other files won't work for this map.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nWanna play custom maps: join the [url=https://discord.gg/Bd9KwxRX]Community Workshop Games server[/url]"}
