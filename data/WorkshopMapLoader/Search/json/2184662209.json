{"Size":"12634048","Description":"ATTENTION: you need the workshop textures below for this map, or else the goals will appear black.\r\n\r\nThis is my first map that I started making last year for fun and just recently finished it. The map leans towards 1v1 or 2v2 game modes. I think this maps idea has potential but as you can tell from its aesthetics it stands as just a test map. Please try it out and have fun!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: \r\nThis map should now be fixed with new and improved boost pads and less texture errors :)\r\n\r\nWorkshop Textures\r\nhttps://rocketleaguemods.com/mods/workshop-textures/"}
