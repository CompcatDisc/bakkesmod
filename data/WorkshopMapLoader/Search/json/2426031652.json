{"Size":"14766585","Description":"Welcome to the Bath Tub, where the entire map is shaped like a Bath Tub! This map is super good for air dribbles and you'll see why!\r\n\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n\r\nThe field is shaped like a bathtub, the goals are on the top. The indent of the tub is one full field in height, so you have to air dribble every ball out! Unless you can hit a pinch that goes the height of two rocket league fields. If you need help getting it out, consider putting on Boomer, Rumble, Low Gravity or another mode like that.\r\n\r\n\r\nMutators:\r\nBoost: Unlimited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLHF!"}
