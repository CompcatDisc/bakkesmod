{"Size":"78536610","Description":"Just like for any other Workshop map, if any textures are missing make sure to download the Workshop Texture pack and follow the instructions from: \r\nhttps://rocketleaguemods.com/mods/workshop-textures/\r\n\r\n\r\nType: obstacle course + ball park at the end\r\nDifficulty: Beginner - Intermediate.\r\n\r\nA non-punishing, beginner-friendly, advanced-oriented obstacle course. At the end you have the central court with the ball at your disposal. Perfect for the first thing you get in to warm up. Some flying then some ball chasing. Feel free to set the rules for yourself: \"as many wall jumps as possible\", or \"no contact with constant air roll\". Don't forget you can fly the map backwards for added variety.\r\n\r\nNote, the map is not as bright as in the video. It's the default Win10 recorder that compresses the color range too much, making bright too bright.\r\n\r\nTo see the full beauty of the map don't forget to set the settings to max.\r\n\r\nShout-out to all Rocket League map makers and modders. I now feel your pain.\r\n\r\nPsyonix \u0026 Epic, if you're reading this, please, oh please add better support for us, modders. If we can contribute to RL, the game will live forever. You can keep monopoly on items, but at the very least allow for easier map creation. I mean I've spent probably 6 hours just trying to figure materials and basically failed. I still couldn't create a material of my own, it just wouldn't load in the game. And the one we can re-use from the game engine, there isn't one that supports fully transparent alpha channel. And the blocking volumes! Don't get me started on that! Why do we need to have blocking volumes for every CSG element. I found a work around, but man it's painful. Before exporting I would create a brush the size of the map, intersect it with the geometry and then add one big blocking volume from that.\r\n\r\nTime spent making: ~20 hours"}
