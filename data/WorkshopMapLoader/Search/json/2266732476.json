{"Size":"21965352","Description":"Inspired by the classic movie scene, your car produces a ribbon of destructive light (while you try to score goals).\r\n\r\n[h1]Multiplayer [/h1]\r\nThis map is meant to be played in multiplayer mode (1v1, 2v2 or 3v3). You can only get destroyed by the ribbons the opposite team leaves behind. To make it harder and to get closer to the movie scene, you can use the high gravity mutator.\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfIIa2cUZSE\u0026t=418s]How to play custom maps with your friends.[/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Single Player [/h1]\r\nFor demonstration purposes I added a simple AI opponent (mirroring your moves) for regular singleplayer mode.\r\n\r\n[h1]Known Issues [/h1]\r\nSometimes after a goal is scored some \"ghost walls\" might  stay on the field. Couldn't figure out a solution to this problem. The replay seems to mess everything up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShoutout to rubenpenax and his [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/jbwni5/i_might_be_crazy_but_what_about_tron_pvp_in/]reddit post[/url] for putting the idea out there. There actually was a little back and forth in the mapmaking discord about who gets to make it. Thanks NewkTV and Shark for letting me have this one."}
