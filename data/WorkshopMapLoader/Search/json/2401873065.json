A game-mode that will set your camera around the map instead of behind your car!\r\n\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nThere are 9 cameras placed around the standard rocket league map. The game will start with a birds-eye-view and then rotate through the other views. At the beginning of every kickoff it resets at birds-eye view. In other words it's a set rotation, because it plays better this way. If someone gets demoed, their camera will be normal until the next cycle so be careful where you're going! \r\n\r\n\r\nMutators: It's a standard map with working boost pads, but without unlimited boost it becomes 100x harder\r\nTurn off Shadows in Video Settings, I will have it fixed for the next maps\r\n- Unlimited Boost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLHF!"}
