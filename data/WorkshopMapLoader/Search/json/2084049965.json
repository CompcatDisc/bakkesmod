A quidditch competitive oriented map; no mutators, only skill!\r\n\r\nThis map is meant for a high skill gameplay, if you are under C2 you should probably add a light ball mutator or rumble so you don't struggle too much to score.\r\n\r\n[u]Game Rules :[/u] \r\n\r\nNO MUTATORS\r\n\r\nLow Ring = 1pt \r\nMedium Ring = 2pts\r\nHigh Ring = 3 pts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Another Quidditch map?\r\n\r\nYes. I played the glhglh map a while ago, it was fun but it lacked competitive aspects, so i created my own version of quidditch.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsyonix if you read this, as you can see we can make great maps using only assets from Rocket League, 0% copyrighted content here.
