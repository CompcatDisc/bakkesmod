This is another version of battlegrounds, but instead of going back and forth, you can go side to side!\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\r\n\r\n- 4v4 game-mode* with 2 balls (Enable it in rocket launcher -\u003e In game mods -\u003e Ball mods)\r\n- DO NOT 1v1. If playing in a 2v2 or 3v3 (4v4 highly reccomended), use 1 ball\r\n- Unlimited Time\r\n- First to 3\r\n- Unlimited Boost\r\n\r\n*If you need help finding people to play custom games with, make sure to check out this server made by Balanced Waffle to find players!\r\nhttps://discord.gg/kVGR4vB\r\n\r\nP.S. Boomer Mode is really fun on this map\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] GLHF! [/h1]\r\n"}
