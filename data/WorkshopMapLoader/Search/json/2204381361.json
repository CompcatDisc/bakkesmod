Has a great guide on mapmaking and without his help I would have struggled to learn anything about UDK. Cheers for everything mate :)\r\n\r\n[b]Gidek[/b]\r\nAnother creator of many maps and a coding genius. I had no idea how I would be able to implement the features like race standings, but this guy just came along and made it look easy. The racing functionality side of things is all him. You the man :D\r\n\t\r\nHope to see some of you on the race track!\r\n\t\r\nPanic.\r\n"}
