{"Size":"107937039","Description":"This map is made for practicing intermediate air dribbles and basic freestyling mechanics. There are shots for practicing conserving momentum and maintaining control in air dribbles and shots specifically designed with flip resets and flip cancels, pinches, and pogos in mind. There are 7 shots in total.\r\n\r\nWatch my play through here: https://youtu.be/aBweEy_r-6g\r\nBehind the scenes / epic fails video here: https://youtu.be/ls7AoA3TqDw\r\n\r\nUse quick chat presets 1 and 2 to skip between levels. I deliberately didn't add a death counter or timer because I don't want people to feel pressured or embarrassed while working on mechanics. If you've completed the map and want more of a challenge, try freestyling it or complicating the shots. Cleaner is better.\r\n\r\nYou'll need the workshop texture pack installed in order to play this map. You can download it from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jklpjfEu4Yw97cjYaMDWRx8H2XFyji6U or https://rocketleaguemods.com/mods/workshop-textures/ and install into c:\\program files (x86)\\steam\\steamapps\\common\\rocketleague\\tagame\\cookedpcconsole.\r\n\r\nIn terms of difficulty, this map sits somewhere between Air Dribble Hoops and Air Dribble Gauntlet.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Mr. Swaggles for answering all my dumb questions.
