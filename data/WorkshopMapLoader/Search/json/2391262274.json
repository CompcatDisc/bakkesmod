{"Size":"74087890","Description":"Welcome to the Alphabet! 26 Arenas for 26 letters, every single letter has 2 goals and one ball. Once you score in one letter, you move onto the next and then once you go through all 26 letters, you start over at the letter A.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of 2/21/2021 there is a bug with Rocket Plugin and it not correctly loading workshop maps. If you intend to play any workshop map, it is recommended to replace underpass instead. For some reason, if you don't you won't be able to play the letters X,Y, or Z. \r\n\r\n\r\nTurn off Dynamic Shadows in Video Settings. This map has weird lighting to ensure that everything is properly lit, but will cause weird shadows to happen with your car\r\n\r\nMutators:\r\n- Time: Unlimited\r\n- Boost Amount: Unlimited\r\n\r\n\r\nBoomer and Rumble are two fun modes that will make it a lot easier. However, I highly recommend you play it normally first.\r\n\r\nDO NOT change the score with Match Admin, This will cause the game to skip 2 letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLHF!"}
