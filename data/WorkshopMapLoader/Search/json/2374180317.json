Another battlegrounds-ish variation where you have to score in all 5 goals in order to win!\r\n\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n\r\nOnce the game starts, score in all 5 goals to get a point! You can track your progress with the in-game HUD in the bottom left. Blue scores on Orange and Orange scores on Blue. Once you score on a goal, a gate will close to show that that goal has been scored on. You have to actually put the ball in the goal in order to score, rolling it on the edge will do nothing. The Gates do not have collision. (I tried for months, and if they had collision it would drop your fps to 15)\r\n\r\n\r\nMutators:\r\n- Turn off Dynamic Shadows in video settings\r\n- Time Limit: Unlimited\r\n- Max Score: 3 recommended (This dictates how long the game is)\r\n- Boost Amount: Unlimited, OR Recharge for a challenge\r\n\r\n\r\nGLHF!"}
